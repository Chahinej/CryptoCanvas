# Steganography Report Readme

This repository contains a report on Steganography, a technique used to hide secret messages within images.


# Overview
This is a report on Steganography, which is the practise of concealing confidential information within a non-confidential medium. The study discusses steganography's method and history, as well as the fundamentals of cryptography and steganography.


The study also discusses the main steganography principles and components, such as the cover image, secret message, steganography algorithm, and steganography key. The functional flow of a steganography system is then outlined, which includes inputting the cover image and secret message, encrypting and embedding the secret message, generating the stego-image, securely transmitting it, extracting the encrypted message, decrypting it, and displaying the secret message.

Furthermore, the report examines and critiques existing steganography solutions such as SSIS, BATCH steganography, PIT, BPCS, LSB, and PVD.

Finally, there is a reference section as well as appendices with additional information and resources.
